-This project implements a neural network for classification of handwritten digits using the R language.
-The data used for this project is the MNIST data set which is a set of over 60000 labled images of handwritten digits.
-The code in "File loader.R" will download, gunzip, and help visualize the data.
-The code in "Neural network.R" contains the code for the training and trsting of the network.
-The rest of the files contain the code for the functions used in "Neural network.R"
-The algorithm used is "stochastic gradient descent".
